Learning Terraform with [Terraform Up &amp; Running by Yevgeniy Brikman](https://www.terraformupandrunning.com)

If you'd like to try creating these resources from your machine, clone this repo and run `terraform apply` in each one of the subdirectories. It is assumed that you have both [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) and [AWS CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html) installed.
